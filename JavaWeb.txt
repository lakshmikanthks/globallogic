Java Web Application on Servlet
What is Servlet : Servlet is a java class that runs in a web server. It cannot be able to run in normal jvm.  So it is not a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) class. It accepts request from a html file, proccesses that request and finally forwards the respone/output to the client's web browser through html file. 

All Servlet/Java web technical classes & interfaces are present in javax.servlet, javax.servlet.http & javax.servlet.jsp packages. 

1. Servlet interface
2. GenericServlet class
3. HttpServlet class
4. ServletRequest interface
5. ServletResponse interface
6. HttpServletRequest interface
7. HttpServletResponse

Every user defined Servlet must  extend GenericServlet/HttpServlet.
GenericServlet implements the Servlet interface. It is an abstract class. It inherites the Object class. It is the base class of all Servlet. 
HttpServlet is the child class of  GenericServlet class. It is also an abstract class. It accommodates the http technical features like get/post, cookies, session variables etc.
ServletRequest interface accepts the web client's request and forward to the Servlet class. 
HttpServletRequest interface accepts the http web client's request and forward to the Servlet class. It is child interface of ServletRequest.
ServletResponse interface forwards the Servlet's output to the client's browser.
HttpServletResponse interface forwards the Servlet's output to the http client's browser.

Apache Tomcat  is a web server. It can execute Java classes. It's default port number is 8080.
