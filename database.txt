User Interface ----> Front End    ---> accepts requests & provides output
Data Processing ----> Middle tier   ---> Java, C#,PHP, Python etc
Data Storage ---> Database ---> RDBMS, NoSql Database, 

What is Database Management System:
It is an application software which consists of related data, data access applications, data storage rules, data access rules & security. 

There are several database designs 
Relational Model:
Under this model,  data are stored in a tabular form (row/columnwise). Each of the data storage unit is known as table. Each table is linked/related to another table through common column. So it is called Relational Database Model.
The operation & design of this database is based on Relational Algebra & Set theory.

SQL types :
DDL : Data Definition Language , It is used to create, modify or delete database schema objects.
             (Schema objects are logical objects through which database programmers interact with database).
              create, alter, drop, rename, truncate
DML : insert, update,delete
DCL : grant, revoke
TCL : commit, rollback ,savepoint
DQL : select
